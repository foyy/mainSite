> “If you can hold your attention, however briefly or occasionally, on the sheer astoshingness of being, and on what a small amount of that being you get–you may experience a palpable shift in how it feels to be here, right now, alive in the flow of time.” - Oliver Burkeman

Something strange happens to me everytime I read, and I’m guessing it affects you too. It might have already started.

At some point, I realize I haven’t been comprehending the last page or so. Even though my eyes were still scanning the words at the same pace, and I was still holding the book in the same way, I have no clue what I just read.

This disconnect between my mind and body is bizarre. My brain has hijacked my attention so completely that it has tricked my body–and my whole sense of self–into thinking I’m doing something I’m not. Without me noticing that anything has changed.

If I were to give some last-dying-breath/number-one-rule/end-all-be-all/golden-nugget piece of advice to anyone, the core of it would be: **_you are doing that same looking-but-not-reading-thing all day long, everyday of your life. But instead of a random book you’re not not understanding, processing, or appreciating, it’s…major cheese incoming… the book of life._**

Your brain, without your permission or recognition, is thinking constantly. And it’s likely making your life much, much, worse. You are being spun up in stories, swept up in emotions, and identified with thoughts, all of which are entirely distracting you from the moment before you. You’re “scanning the pages” of life but not actually reading them.

The truth and consequences of this phenomenon are bonkers and can’t be communicated with just language--especially if you are already thinking this is some kind of nonsense. BUT, I think I can peak your curiosity enough for you to keep thinking and see for yourself experientially. So here I go.

The core of it is a few parts, that when all put together, make for a real unfortunate default state of being:

- **You are thinking most of the day**
- **You don’t realize you are thinking**
- **You’re not deciding what to think about**
- **The thoughts usually aren’t positive, and are frequently negative**
- **You are becoming identified with/as the thoughts**
- **The thoughts are robbing the joy and wonder of the present moment**
- **You can practice pausing this pattern, getting better and quicker to be attentive to the present moment**

## You are thinking most of the day

Five years ago I would have thought this idea was wack. Even being prone to absent-mindedness and daydreaming, there’s no way I was thinking all day long. Then one day, when I was teaching high school at a super-ultra-mega academically competitive school, the teachers attended a presentation on stress-reduction techniques we could try with our students, since so many of them were stressed constantly.

The presenters explained that focusing on an object for a few minutes and pausing our thoughts while doing is a helpful exercise to reduce stress and manage anxiety. They had the teachers try and simply notice what our breath felt like for a couple of minutes, and not to think during that time.

And _holy shit_ I could not do it. For even 15 seconds at a time. It was like I was a flag in a strong wind, being waved around by whatever my brain wanted to throw at me: _That was an awkward conversation I had with Sarah yesterday, I should really make more money, I wonder if I’ll have to go to that get-together this weekend. I’m hungry. I should be saving more for retirement. I still need to lose weight. I wish I was home. This is boring. Why am I doing this?_

And what’s really wild is, I did not realize I was lost in those thoughts until much later. It’s like the thought snuck up on me, hypnotized me without me knowing, and then 20 seconds down the line I’d shake it off, and re-focus on my breathing. Then BOOM, 20 seconds later I would rinse and repeat.

It was deeply frustrating but fascinating. How could I not have control over my brain for 20 seconds at a time? How does that make any sense?

But the craziest part isn’t that I was distracted during those 2 minutes, it’s that **I was distracted by random thoughts all day long**. I was churning on regrets, anxieties, worries, random images, made-up narratives, or whatever else my brain wanted to throw out there, all completely without me realizing it.

It wasn’t the breath I was losing focus on, it was my life.

## You don’t realize you are thinking

So, you know how when you put on sunglasses, you almost immediately forget you have them on? The world more-or-less becomes whatever color the lenses are. You’re not thinking: _"Ah yes those are pretty clouds but they really are a few shades lighter."_ It just is.

Being distracted by thought is like that. Everything is filtered through whatever you are thinking about, and you don’t recognize you’ve got the glasses on. Whether it’s a mountain-top view or a human you deeply care about, it’s still distorted by whatever gradient that lens is. The metaphor continues, as the worse the thought, the darker the lens. But most importantly, it’s this weird phenomena of seeing-the-world-but-not-really-seeing-the-world that’s the point here, as **you really are not aware it’s happening until you notice it. And most of us never notice it.**

I feel this all the time when I am watching my son Holden. He is almost two and is goofy and hilarious and sweet and I’m really bonding with him for the first time. It’s literally the coolest thing I’ve ever experienced. So, I really make an effort to “push the sunglasses” up off my eyes, enjoying this unique time that many people consider the best of what life has to offer.

And yet, I’m constantly getting distracted with thoughts when I’m with him. I’ll be on the ground, playing with his trucks and giggling and it’s just the freakin’ best. Except after about fifteen seconds when the sunglasses fall over my eyes again.
And once again, I’m not really there. I’m thinking again about my weight or money or replaying a conversation with a coworker. Or a million other things that have no positive effect on anything. All of that is happening without me realizing it.

## You’re not deciding what to think about

This one is so, so wild to me. It’s also the idea I have the least insight on. Like, what in the world is actually going on when our brains are throwing thoughts at us randomly? How is it choosing what to think about? Where are they really coming from? Why don’t I have more control over it?

There’s likely a humanity-has-evolved-but-our-monkey-brains-haven’t answer here (as there is with what seems like everything). I don’t have proof for this, but it’s not a hard logical leap to make: to find food, shelter, and keep ourselves/tribe safe likely required a constant stream of stressful thoughts just to keep us alive, let alone thriving or future-proof. The better our ancestor was at keeping our threats assessed, the more likely they were to survive and have thought-riddled babies.

And now, we might be left with the same near-constant thought production, but without the real necessity for it. So instead of “what are we going to eat to survive” it’s “I really want pizza tonight but know I shouldn’t” or instead of “I hope my monkey-pal BokBop doesn’t kill me” it’s “I’m sad and mad that Hunter made fun of my shoes in front of everyone at the party.”

Unfortunately, our buzzing thoughts aren’t actively helping us. No matter how much I subconsciously think about that work presentation Friday, I’m not likely to think anything actually productive. Maybe occasionally–maybe. Most of the time though, we’ve got all the distraction without any of the utility.

## The thoughts are robbing you of the joy and wonder of the present moment

The next couple points are largely summarized by an awesome John Milton quote:

> “The mind is its own place and, in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven.” - John Milton

Or, in other words, the quality of our experience is based on the quality of our mind.
To be clear–I don’t think the extremes are all that common. While some people are making a hell out of their everyday life, I think it’s far more common that we are substantially dulling our everyday life by letting ourselves get caught up in mid-to-moderate level non-positive thought. Here are some examples:

- While doing the dishes today I noticed I was mulling over a meeting at work I have later this week that’s going to be awkward and I was mentally playing it out in my head.
- While I was playing with Holden I was wondering how much more money I could make if I learned all about NFTs and cryptocurrency or if it's just a scam.
- While I was eating lunch I was remembering a conversation I had with a friend of mine and then was wondering if those new people I met that day liked me.
- While doing yard work the other weekend I noticed I was wondering what my life would have been like If I kept playing music and started regretting not doing that.

Again, I was aware of none of these thoughts/stories until I was. Who knows how long they held my attention. And this kind of thing is happening constantly with thoughts that are not positive, and all of them are somewhat negative.

Now, you might think that some are useful, and maybe that is true, but there should be a separate time and place where I mull these issues over. If NFTs and cryptocurrency plays could be beneficial, I should reserve some time to actually research them. Just mildly stressing about it isn’t useful and is actively damaging.

Same with all of the points. If there is a kernel of truth, it should be explored deliberately. Not in this spur-of-the-moment way that doesn’t actually solve anything and only pulls me away from whatever I’m doing. Since I’m not even aware they are happening, there’s no way for me to take action on them. They just become a current that sweeps my days along. These are micro moments of anxiety and stress that add up to a much different life experience.

But for some people, this is a different story. Due to past traumas, chemistry imbalances, bad habits, bad environment, poor parenting, poor impulse control, poor who-knows-what-makes-us-the-way-we-really-are, etc–their brains are making a hell of life.
Mental health issues seem rampant particularly post-pandemic. And while I’m in no means prescribing the solution, there is something fundamental here worth paying attention to. **Namely, that if our brains are responsible for the quality of our experience, improving our minds will improve our experience. And reducing the hold that random and unproductive thoughts have on us is one of the most beneficial things we can do to our minds.** This has certainly been the case for me.

## What we’re missing out on

There's another useful glasses analogy here:

Being distracted by thought is like wearing prescription glasses that we don’t need. We wander through the world while things are blurry and misshapen and it’s difficult to focus on any one thing. We stub our toes and get distracted and walk in the wrong directions and eventually our head begins to hurt.

The main point here though, isn't so much the out-of-focus wandering, but just how amazing things look when they come into focus. Because what you thought you were looking at is much, much, much cooler than you had realized.

There’s effectively no end to how awesome this is, as there really is no end to just how cool the universe and existence is. It’s functionally endless. **A child-like state of wonder really is the most natural and mature response to existence. And when we can tap into that--free from thought and with clear attention--we see life as the beautiful and strange miracle that it is. And there's no response but to swell with gratitude and awe and a kind of humble tranquility before it.**

Now, this seems hyperbolic–I get that. Also, somehow this kind of language feels religious, or spiritual, so I hope this point doesn’t get lost in that category, as there's nothing supernatural about it.

The clear, irrefutable point is that it is wild and strange and awesome to be anything at all. And our thinking is very much getting in the way of really feeling and operating in that truth. Of course, we have to go about our lives doing the things humans just have to do, so we can’t all be fundamentally amazed all the time.

But this kind of mindest can become our default mode if we practice it. If we can do that, the sky's the limit to its usefulness, as suddenly things like gratitude and peace and tranquility and wonder become a part of your default mode of being, as there’s no way to really see the world–and our wild, tiny, wonderful little part of it–and not feel those things.

## So, What Now?

If you didn’t agree or resonate with anything I’ve said, but are still interested, the first thing to do is go try not thinking for two minutes. Pick an object and try to study what it looks like. Or a sound and what it sounds like. Can be anything, really. Your desk, your computer keyboard, the sky, your breath also being an excellent choice.

Now, you won’t be able to do it, no matter how hard you try. If you think you’re doing it–you’re likely just not even aware of how lost in thought you really are.  
And then take that bit of befuddlement and try to notice that your inability to control your brain for those 2 minutes is actually being played out all day long, but the cost isn’t being able to focus on that object, it’s being able to focus on life. This is weirdly hard to do sometimes, even if it’s literally happening all day. But some easy moments I’ve found to notice this are:

- Doing the dishes
- Taking a shower
- Getting dressed
- In a conversation with someone you aren't the biggest fan of
- Eating food
- If you ever have to wait on anything, literally for any amount of time

Pick one of those events and see if you can’t catch yourself spinning some nonsense thought.

And again, I’m not talking about the kind spaced-out, visibly distracted, lost-in-thought-ness that other people might notice. What I’m talking about is more or less anytime you aren’t in a “flow state”, you are likely ruminating on whatever it is that your brain decides to throw at you.

Finally, the core of everything I've been talking about really falls under the term **mindfulness**. And the formal practice of focusing on an object/breath is **meditation**. I’ve purposefully not used those terms here because for whatever reason, they have a connotation that kept me away from the WILDY practical benefits of what I’ve talked about here. I had just assumed that meditation and mindfulness were /hipster/hippie/new-age fads. Which is crazy wack. They are the most useful, grounded, logical, beneficial practices I have ever learned.

There are legitimately thousands of years of information about mindfulness and meditation but for me, nothing beats [The Waking Up](https://wakingup.com/) App. The quality of the conversation and teachers and lectures are so high that I’m close to 4 years into using it nearly-daily and still am truly amazed by it. I can’t think of something I pay for that is worth the money (and in fact you can get for free if you email them). If that’s not your vibe then [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) is usually the next most recommended. Again, there are so many good resources out there.
