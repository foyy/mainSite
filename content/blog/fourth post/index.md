You know that thing where you read halfway down a page and realize you weren’t actually understanding anything?

You’ve just scanned the words at the same pace, and your eyes still think you’re reading. Yet, you have no idea what was said.
Your brain, ever the trickster, has hijacked your attention entirely with some kind of thought. And now you have to go back, find where your brain went rouge, and re-read the page to see what in the world. Or power on and hope it wasn’t important.

My last-dying-breath piece of advice to my kids will be: you are doing that same looking-but-not-reading-thing all day long, everyday of your life. But instead of a random book you’re not not reading, understanding, or appreciating, it’s…major cheese incoming..._the book of life_.

Your brain, at no direction of your own, is thinking all day long. And it’s likely making your life much, much, worse than it could be. It is spinning stories, or being smacked around by emotions, or becoming identified with thoughts that are entirely distracting you from the actual moment before you, causing you to be “scanning the pages” of life but not actually reading them. And reading is the first layer you’re missing out on–you’re not coming close to appreciating in that moment either.

How true this is, and how giant a bummer it is, really can’t be conveyed by me with words, especially if you are already thinking this is some kind of nonsense. BUT I think I can peak your curiosity enough for you to keep thinking about it and see for yourself. So here I go.

The core of it is a few parts, that when all put together, make for a real unfortunate default state of being:

> - You are thinking most of the day
> - You don’t realize you are thinking
> - You’re not deciding what to think about
> - The thoughts usually aren’t positive, and are frequently negative
> - You are becoming identified with/as the thoughts
> - The thoughts are distracting you from life, robbing you of the joy and wonder of the present moment
>   You can practice pausing this pattern, getting better and quicker to be attentive to the present moment

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
  - this is very interesting
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
