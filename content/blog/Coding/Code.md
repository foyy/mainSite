Hello!

I'm in the process of rebuilding/redoing this site, so pardon the lack of...anything.

I've been fullstack dev for 4 years and have done a good chunk of time in management. I really love both--and find it very hard to pick a "lane". I think my natural skillset swings toward management, but I do really love coding and systems.

Lately, I have been falling in love with the architecture and development of complex distributed backend systems. Wow, are the problems of data-intensive systems both fascinating and endless.

I’ve also been helping design and refactor a core user-data service from REST/SQL to GraphQL/noSQL using Nest.js. It's been rad. I’m also currently helping to develop a very tricky second-by-second data ingestion pipeline for our leaderboard technology. Also rad.

Prior to that, I was managing 6 teams of engineers. I really dug getting to have a macro-level view on systems and a micro level view on people. I also really liked helping people grow their careers while navigating deadlines/tricky problems/all the things. I do think this is where my passions/personality/skillset converge.

I have also worked as a part-time teacher and mentor at various bootcamps, building junior engineers in web development technologies.

And before all that I was a high school English teacher! Which I also loved doing and think I'll do again someday.

But most of all I'm a dad to a wonderful two year old--Holden--who gets cooler everyday. And I'm a husband to a wonderful lady. And I have two Boston Terriers who are insane and awesome.

I'm really into reading and music and videogames and mindfulness as well.

If you're interested in getting in touch about my experience and skill-set, the best way to reach me is the phone number or email below:

Hope you have a good day,
